# My First Post 

## Overview 

Thanks for **BY** and **Te_Lee**, I have finished my first post using [github pages](https://pages.github.com) and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). If you hope to learn how to establish your own website and blog using Markdown syntax, you can have a look on those links (Chinese Version, I'm trying to do the translation).

## A few Tips for Tags I used

* Technology: 

    1. How to Wiki: If it's my original post, I will write it in English. If I used a Chinese reference, I will try to translate it.
    
    2. Coding Skills: 
    
        * 2018-06-18: Review Basic Data Structures & Algorithms (with a few LeetCode Problems)
        
        * 2018-06-31: Reorganize some of my past projects (Capstones, 95880 Python, 94842 R, 95712 Java, 95702 Distributed System, 95869 Big Data and Large Scale, 10601 Machine Learning, 95865 Text Analytics, etc.)
        
    3. Specific Bugs

* Food: Recipes & Restaurants Recommendation

* Life: 

    1. Daily Life Records
    
    2. Thoughts

If you have any questions or want to discuss with me, please comment or email me at <cici_951114@me.com>!
